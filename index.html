        <div class="col-6"><span class="myfont2">So, if you havent known already, this I am Justin Carr, or <strong>Mr. M.</strong> Just a breif summary of myself, I live in Makaha, just like my real life identity, and I live on the island of Oahu on the westside where my base is located.</span> </div>
        
        <div class="col-6"><span class="myfont"> Hello. My name is Justin Carr, and I come from the islands that are out in the middle of the Pacific ocean. If you haven't guessed it, I am from the Hawaiian Islands, and live on the island of Oahu. I live on the west side, in waianae, in the region of Makaha, and I attend <em>Kamaile Academy.</em></span></div>

    <div class="row">
        <!-- what I do -->
      <div class="col-6"><span class="myfont2">So, if you haven't guessed it yet, I do indeed have somthing that someone would classify as a secret identity. You probably know me as Justin, but really, I could also go by the name of <strong>Mr. M</strong></span></div>
      
        <div class="col-6"><span class="myfont">So, now that you know the general  area that I live, lets talk about how I live and what I have done for the past 13 years of my life. On week days, I go to school, <em>obviously,</em> and at school I do all of my work and basically just be the best student that I can be so that I can get a good career in the future. Also, on wednesday's.</span> </div>

        <div class="col-6"><span class="myfont">As you may know, yes, I lied. Turns out that people can have super powers. As of myself, I would like to say that mine is quite handy, and it's also where I get the name, Mr.M. I, myself, can acually create money with my mind. I know, I can buy as many lay's chips as I want, but more importantly, with such a great power, comes great responsibility.<!-- this wasn't suppose to be a movie quote by the way, just saying-->.This means that I can't abuse my powers and buying all the manshion, but should only limit them.</span></div>  
      
        
      <div class="col-6"><span class="myfont">So, as you probably know, people can't have <strong>super powers</strong>, <strong>obviously,</strong> but they can have certain skills and areas that they excell in. For instance, <em>Albert Einstein</em>, he was great at math and science. For me, I like math and science as well, but I would say I excell at math more. But, I also have another skill that I am learning that is wanted a lot now-a-days. That skll being coding. I have learned Javascript and html, but I mostly focus on html.</span></div>
